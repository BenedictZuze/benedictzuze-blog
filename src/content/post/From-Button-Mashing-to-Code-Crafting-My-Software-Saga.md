In the realm of software development, every journey begins with a spark of curiosity and a desire to create something extraordinary. For me, this journey commenced during my primary school days, fueled by a deep fascination with video games. Blessed with access to both a personal desktop computer and a PlayStation 2, I was immersed in the captivating world of gaming from a young age.

However, it wasn't until my secondary school years that the realm of computer science truly caught my attention. In Form 3, I was introduced to game development, and the sheer ingenuity behind creating these immersive experiences left me spellbound. It was my first encounter with programming‚Äîan art form that seemed both daunting and exhilarating.

Like any novice, I turned to the vast expanse of the internet for guidance, seeking answers to questions like, "What is the best programming language for game development?" The consensus led me to C++, and thus began my journey into the intricate world of coding. Yet, mastering C++ proved to be a formidable challenge. The syntax was alien, and comprehension eluded my 15-year-old self. Nevertheless, driven by my passion for game development, I persevered, trudging through tutorials until the pieces began to fall into place.

As I approached the crossroads of my academic career in Form 4, the path ahead seemed clear. Fueled by my love for video games and programming, I set my sights on pursuing Computer Science at the University of Malawi‚Äîan opportunity I cherished dearly.

My journey took me through a whirlwind of mathematical marvels and coding conquests. Java became my trusty steed, carrying me through the verdant fields of object-oriented programming, and it was defintely easier to learn and use than C++. But amidst the sea of algorithms and equations, a new passion began to stir within me: the art of software development.

From there, my journey took me to my first two years of University which to my surprise Computer Science involved way more mathematics than I expected, college algebra, trignometry and elementary calculus, Calculus 1 and 2, Discrete mathematics, and due to how many college stuctures their programs I had to take extra Physics and Statistics courses. We mostly learnt in Java, which become my second programming language to learn and I learnt how to structure my code much better as well as object-oriented programming.

I later got introduced to the Rust programming language and immediately fell in love with it. I took a Web Development course, where I learnt JavaScript and Typescript.

As I ventured deeper into the wilds of my third year, I found myself facing new challenges and opportunities at every turn. Data structures and algorithms became my fiercest adversaries, testing the limits of my coding prowess. But with perseverance and a dash of creativity, I emerged victorious, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead. I also took a course on Computer Security which got me interested in Cyber Security, I learnt system/server administration, human computer interaction, as well as software development where I got to know how to build a project together with a group of people (I was mostly a solo-dev at this point).

And so, dear reader, here we are. My software odyssey has brought me to this very moment, where I stand on the precipice of a new frontier. With each line of code, I carve out my own path through the digital wilderness, eager to see where this journey will take me.

So buckle up, fellow travelers, for the adventure of a lifetime awaits. Together, we'll explore the vast expanse of the software universe, one line of code at a time. And who knows? With a bit of luck and a whole lot of determination, we might just uncover the secrets of this brave new world.

Until next time, happy coding! ‚öîÔ∏èüöÄ
