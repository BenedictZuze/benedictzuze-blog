Hey there, fellow code adventurers! Today, I'm thrilled to share with you the epic tale of my journey through the realms of software development. Picture this: a young gamer, armed with nothing but a PlayStation 2 and a passion for pixelated worlds, embarks on a quest to conquer the elusive land of programming.

It all started back in primary school, where my love of video games was as strong as my addiction to cheesy snacks. With a trusty home desktop and my beloved PS2 by my side, I was ready to dive headfirst into the virtual unknown.

Moving on to secondary school, computer science was still not on my radar. However, during Form 3, I discovered the captivating world of game development. The temptation to create my own digital masterpieces was too strong to ignore.

Armed with nothing but curiosity and a desire to learn, I delved into the arcane arts of programming. Like any brave adventurer, I turned to the internet for guidance, seeking answers to the question: 'What's the best programming language for game development?' The consensus pointed me towards the mystical land of C++.

Learning C++ was like navigating a labyrinth filled with syntax monsters and logic puzzles. At the age of 15, I was overwhelmed with confusion. However, driven by my passion for creating epic adventures, I persevered, gradually unraveling the secrets of the language.

By the time I reached the crossroads of Form 4, it was decision time. And what better path to choose than one paved with lines of code and endless possibilities? With a heart set on game development, I embarked on a quest for knowledge at the University of Malawi, majoring in Computer Science.

From there, my journey took me to my first year of University through a whirlwind of mathematical marvels and coding conquests. Java became my trusty steed, carrying me through the verdant fields of object-oriented programming, it was. But amidst the sea of algorithms and equations, a new passion began to stir within me: the art of software development.

From there, my journey took me to my first two years of University which to my surprise Computer Science involved way more mathematics than I expected, college algebra, trignometry and elementary calculus, Calculu 1 and 2, Discrete mathematics, and due to how many college stuctures their programs I had to take extra Physics and Statistics courses. We mostly learnt in Java, which become my second programming language to learn and I learnt how to structure my code much better as well as object-oriented programming.

I later got introduced to the Rust programming language and immediately fell in love with it. I took a Web Development course, where I learnt JavaScript and Typescript.

As I ventured deeper into the wilds of my third year, I found myself facing new challenges and opportunities at every turn. Data structures and algorithms became my fiercest adversaries, testing the limits of my coding prowess. But with perseverance and a dash of creativity, I emerged victorious, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead. I also took a course on Computer Security which got me interested in Cyber Security, I learn system/server administration, human computer interaction, as well as software development where it got to know how to build a project together with a group of people (I was mostly a solo-dev at this point).

And so, dear reader, here we are. My software odyssey has brought me to this very moment, where I stand on the precipice of a new frontier. With each line of code, I carve out my own path through the digital wilderness, eager to see where this journey will take me.

So buckle up, fellow travelers, for the adventure of a lifetime awaits. Together, we'll explore the vast expanse of the software universe, one line of code at a time. And who knows? With a bit of luck and a whole lot of determination, we might just uncover the secrets of this brave new world.

Until next time, happy coding! ‚öîÔ∏èüöÄ
