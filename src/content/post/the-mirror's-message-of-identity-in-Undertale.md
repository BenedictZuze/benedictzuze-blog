## Undertale's Mirror Moments: A Profound Reflection on Identity

Back when Undertale came out in 2015 it was and still is one of my favorite game. It had a great story and great characters that left you invested in the world. I especially liked the multiple interactions the main character has with multiple different objects and characters throughout the playthrough. One such interaction which am go write about today is the character's interaction with mirrors.

In the world of Undertale, developer Toby Fox masterfully weaves intricate narratives and profound messages through seemingly innocuous interactions. One such instance that resonates deeply is the character's encounters with mirrors throughout the game's progression. These mirror moments serve as sentimental reminders of the individual's enduring essence, transcending the trials and tribulations of their journey.

In the early stages of Undertale, the player character encounters a mirror that simply states, "It's you." This straightforward affirmation establishes the character's identity as the central focus, setting the stage for an introspective adventure. However, upon interacting with the same mirror again, the response shifts to "It's still you." This subtle change carries a profound weight, implying that despite any initial perceptions or actions, the character's core identity remains intact.

As the game progresses, the narrative takes unexpected turns, challenging the player's moral compass and forcing them to confront the consequences of their choices. It is during this tumultuous period that the character stumbles upon another mirror, prompting the haunting message: "Despite everything, it's still you." This statement cuts deeper, acknowledging the transformative experiences endured while reassuring the character that their fundamental self has persevered.

Undertale's mirror interactions serve as a profound meditation on identity, reminding us that our essence remains steadfast even as we navigate life's complexities. The mirrors act as a grounding force, anchoring the character to their true self amidst the maelstrom of events that threaten to alter or obscure their sense of self.

Toby Fox's masterful storytelling through these simple interactions is a testament to the power of symbolism in video games. The mirrors transcend their functional purpose, becoming metaphorical mirrors for the player's own introspection. They challenge us to confront our choices, actions, and the consequences they beget, while reassuring us that our core identity remains intact, if we choose to embrace it.

In a world where identities are constantly reshaped by external forces, Undertale's mirror moments serve as a sentimental reminder to stay true to ourselves, even in the face of adversity. It is a profound exploration of the human condition, wrapped in the guise of a charming indie game, leaving an indelible mark on those who embark on this journey of self-discovery.
