		<h1 class="title">About Benedict Zuze</h1>
		<p>
			Hello there! I'm Benedict, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Malawi.
			Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my adventures in software development,
			gaming, and sports.

		<h2 class="title">Background</h2>
		<p>
			Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by computers and the endless possibilities they
			offer. That fascination led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I've been delving
			deep into the intricacies of software development and system architecture.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">Passions and Interests</h2>
		<p>
			When I'm not buried in code, you'll often find me immersed in the world of video games or
			cheering for my favorite sports teams. Gaming has been a passion of mine for as long as I can
			remember, and I love exploring new worlds and tackling challenges in virtual environments.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">Specializations</h2>
		<p>
			In the vast realm of software development, I've found myself drawn to two main areas: game
			development and systems programming. I thrive on the creativity and technical challenges of
			game development, while systems programming allows me to dive into the nitty-gritty details of
			computer architecture and optimization.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">Technologies and Frameworks</h2>
		<p>
			I'm constantly expanding my toolkit, but some of my favorite languages include Rust, C#, Java,
			and TypeScript/JavaScript. When it comes to frameworks, I enjoy experimenting with NextJS,
			Astro, Actix, Axum, and Tauri, among others.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">Mission and Goals</h2>
		<p>
			Through this blog, I aim to document my journey as a student and a developer, sharing
			insights, tutorials, and projects along the way. Whether you're a fellow student, a seasoned
			developer, or just curious about the world of technology, I hope you'll find something here to
			inspire and inform you.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title">Projects</h2>
		<p>
			I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from game prototypes to web
			applications. Feel free to check out my portfolio for a closer look at some of my recent
			endeavors.
